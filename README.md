<h1 align="center">Proyect Tic - Tac - Toe</h1>

<h2> Description: </h2>

In the bootcamp of GeeksHubs i am tasked to create a version of the game Tic - Tac - Toe.
I have to make the game fully functional and a few other things:
- It has to have an initial page.
- A page designed to enter the names of the players.
- Another page with the game itself. 
- And a last one that shows the winner of the game.
- The name of the player have to reach the last page and show it.

<h3>My version of the game: </h3>

<p> Initially, I was going to make the game with different themes, the board having different tones that the player can choose from.</p>
<p> That the player could choose different token to play among other things, but the reality of the matter is that initially I lacked the knowledge to do everything so i opted for something simpler, and I focused on making it fully functional and then later on the graphic part of the game.</p>

<h2> Features: </h2>
<p> - The game have 2 modes to play, a normal one with the normal board with music when you put the first token and fully responsive for mobile and a few different resolution.</p>
<p> - And a mode for ........ i really don´t know when, but the music kick-ass. (Warning for loud sound and drastic change of colors).</p>
<p> - It has a short manual. </p>
<p> - The game have a few cool css features with look awesome</p>

This is the initial game menu vs the final one that I made.
